In graph theory, graph coloring is a special case of graph labeling; it is an assignment of labels traditionally called ”colors” to elements of a graph subject to certain constraints. In its simplest form, it is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices are of the same color; this is called a vertex coloring. Similarly, an edge coloring assigns a color to each edge so that no two adjacent edges are of the same color, and a face coloring of a planar graph assigns a color to each face or region so that no two faces that share a boundary have the same color.
However, graph coloring is a kind of typical NP-Complete problem.
In this paper, we propose a feasible solution to the map coloring problem based on the Welsh- Powell algorithm and supplement it with a mathematical proof that it can find the approximate optimal feasible solution with O(n^2) time complexity.
In the final test, the model performed well, and it is proved to be correct and optimal solution in the test.
